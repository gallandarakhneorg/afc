So shaken as we are, so wan with care, \
Find we a time for frighted peace to pant, \
And breathe short-winded accents of new broils \
To be commenced in strands afar remote. \
No more the thirsty entrance of this soil \
Shall daub her lips with her own children''s blood; \
Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields, \
Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs \
Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes, \
Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven, \
All of one nature, of one substance bred, \
Did lately meet in the intestine shock \
And furious close of civil butchery \
Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks, \
March all one way and be no more opposed \
Against acquaintance, kindred and allies: \
The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife, \
No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends, \
As far as to the sepulchre of Christ, \
Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross \
We are impressed and engaged to fight, \
Forthwith a power of English shall we levy; \
Whose arms were moulded in their mothers'' womb \
To chase these pagans in those holy fields \
Over whose acres walk''d those blessed feet \
Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail''d \
For our advantage on the bitter cross. \
But this our purpose now is twelve month old, \
And bootless ''tis to tell you we will go: \
Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear \
Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland, \
What yesternight our council did decree \
In forwarding this dear expedience.
