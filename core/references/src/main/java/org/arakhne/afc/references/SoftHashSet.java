/**
 * A <tt>Set</tt> implementation with {@link SoftReference soft values}. An entry in a
 * <tt>SoftHashSet</tt> will automatically be removed when its value is no
 * longer in ordinary use or null.
 *
 * <p>This class was inspirated from {@link WeakHashMap} and uses a {@link HashSet}
 * as its internal data structure.
 *
 * <p>This class has a special flag which permits to control the
 * way how the released references are expurged: {@link #isDeeplyExpurge()},
 * {@link #setDeeplyExpurge(boolean)}. If this flag is <code>true</code>,
 * all the released references will be immediately removed from the map even
 * if they are not enqueued by the virtual machine (see {@link #expurge()}.
 * If this flag is <code>false</code>,
 * only the enqueued references will be removed from the map
 * (see {@link #expurgeQueuedReferences()}.
 *
 * <p>If this map does not use a "deep expurge" of the released references,
 * it could contains <code>null</code> values that corresponds to
 * values that are released by the garbage collector. If a "deep expurge"
 * is used, all the values released by the garbage collector will be
 * removed from the map.
 *
 * <p>"Deep expurge" consumes much more time that "No deep expurge". This is the
 * reason why this feature is not activated by default.
 *
 * <p>The "deep expurge" feature was added to fix the uncoherent behavior
 * of the garbage collector which seems to not always enqueued the
 * released values (sometimes the queue is empty even if a value was released).
 *
 * @param <E> is the type of the values.
