	 * and <code>R</code> such that all points of <code>L</code> are
	 * to the left of the most leftmost points in <code>R</code>.<br>

	 * 
	 * <li>To merge in 3D need to construct a cylinder of triangles
	 * connecting the left hull and the right hull.</li>
	 * 
	 * <li>One edge of the cylinder <code>AB</code> is just the lower
	 * common tangent. The upper common tangent can be found in
	 * linear time by scanning around the left hull in a clockwise
	 * direction and around the right hull in an anti-clockwise
	 * direction. The two tangents divide each hull into two pieces.
	 * The edges belonging to one of thse pieces must be deleted.</li>
	 * 
	 * <li>We next need to find a triangle ABC belonging to the
	 * cylinder which has AB as one of its edges. The third vertex
	 * of the triangle (C) must belong to either the left hull or the
	 * right hull. (In this case it belongs to the right hull.)
	 * Consequently, either AC is an edge of the left hull or BC is
	 * an edge of the right hull. (In this case BC is an edge of the
	 * right hull.) Hence, when considering possible candidates for the
	 * third vertex it is only necessary to consider candidates that
	 * are adjacent to A in the left hull or adjacent to B in the
	 * right hull.<br>
	 * If we use a data structure for the hulls that allow us to find
	 * an adjacent vertex in constant time then the search for vertex
	 * C takes time proportional to the number of candidate vertices
	 * checked.</li>
	 * 
	 * <li>After finding triangle ABC we now have a new edge AC that
	 * joins the left hull and the right hull. We can find triangle
	 * ACD just as we did ABC. Continuing in this way, we can find all
	 * the triangles belonging to the cylinder, ending when we get back
	 * to AB.<br>
	 * The total time to find the cylinder is O(n) so the algorithm
	 * takes O(n log n) time.</li>
