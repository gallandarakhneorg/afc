/**
 * This class is an iterator on the segments

 * The behaviour of the iterator is strongly influenced by the constructor's parameters.
 * One of the most important parameter is <var>assumeOrientedSegments</var>.
 * The <var>assumeOrientedSegments</var> parameter indicates how the segments are considered
 * by the iterator. If <var>assumeOrientedSegments</var> is <code>true</code> it means
 * that a segment reached by one of its end point is different than the same segment reached
 * by the other end point. If <var>assumeOrientedSegments</var> is <code>false</code> it means
 * that the end points of the segments are not take into account.
 * 
 * @param <PT> is the type of node in the graph
 * @param <ST> is the type of edge in the graph
